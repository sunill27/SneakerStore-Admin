// Hook's in react-redux like useDispatch() , useSelector() don't have types so we don't use them instead we create own hooks.

import { TypedUseSelectorHook, useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { AppDispatch, RootState } from './store';

// Customized Hooks:
export const useAppDispatch: () => AppDispatch =
  useDispatch as () => AppDispatch;
export const useAppSelector: TypedUseSelectorHook<RootState> = useSelector;
